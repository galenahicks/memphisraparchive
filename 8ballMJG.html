<div class="articlebody">
    One of the pioneers of Southern rap, 8Ball and MJG, emerged from Memphis, Tennessee in the early '90s and, aligned with the Houston, 
    Texas-based independent label Suave Records, quickly garnering a tremendous regional following while proving highly influential to a 
    generation of aspiring, independent-minded rap artists and entrepreneurs. The pioneering duo enjoyed increasing recognition as the years
     passed, releasing a couple albums, namely Comin' Out Hard (1994) and In Our Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1999), which would become Southern rap 
     milestones, along with classic singles like "Space Age Pimpin'."

            <span class="bold">Eightball:</span><br><br>It was always just me and my mama in Orange Mound, which was like regular inner-city life. I grew up on Tunstall Street, 
            then, when we moved to Lamar Circle, I got bussed out to Ridgeway. I went there from seventh to ninth grade—me and MJG met there in 
            seventh grade. We had classes together, and we rode the bus together. From tenth till graduation, we went to Middle College High School,
             which was a fairly new program in downtown Memphis. I think we were part of the second graduating class over there.<br><br>

            After kicking it in the classroom, we found out that we lived around the block from each other, and we began hanging out from that 
            point on. Me and MJG used to hang around this little pool hall back in the day. That's where I got my name. It was right across the 
            street from the Lamar-Airways Shopping Center, where Metro Records was at.<br><br>

            <span class="bold">MJG:</span><br><br> I stayed on Sample Street, right by the Lamar-Airways Shopping Center. It was the 1980s, and they were bussing everybody to other 
            schools out of the neighborhood. For some reason, we both ended up going to Ridgeway.<br><br>

                <span class="bold">Eightball:</span><br><br> Our folks listened to a lot of soul music, but we liked rap and hip-hop. I was a big Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J fan, into Steady B and Cool C, and stuff like that, then we grew into N.W.A. and Ice-T. Back in the day, we were big fans of Gangsta Pat and Pretty Tony, who were the men of the hour. <br><br>
    
                <span class="bold">MJG:</span><br><br> As a child, I listened to a lot of types of music, which made me appreciate the way music is made. My grandmama used to watch the Grammy 
    Awards and the American Music Awards, and through her I heard Hank Williams and Merle Haggard. My dad was into jazz and soul music. Then, for 
    a while, I went to Melrose High School, where I played trumpet in the marching band. We played stuff that we didn't know about, classical songs 
    or holiday songs. We'd get that sheet music, and it might not be a song you knew anything about or liked. So that exposure came from a lot of 
    different places, but all of it helped me appreciate music as a whole. <br><br>
    
    The Memphis music legacy is part of what makes us us, as well, because we were born and bred around it. All we've heard about all our lives is the legacy of Memphis music—we either have friends or some type of family member involved in it, who may have made a record or played live. If I wasn't a rapper, I'd have been in music or the entertainment industry in some form, singing in the choir, or dancing, or something.

       The song Stay Fly by <span class="purptext">Three Six Mafia</span> feat. 8Ball and MJG is one of the most recognizable songs from this era of Memphis underground. The song was a guaranteed
       hit as two of the most successful Memphis rap groups came together to create this song, and unofficial Memphis anthem.

            This song shows how Memphis rap began to change and morph. As 8Ball and MJG signed to a Houston-based label, they took the Memphis sound that they
            had cultivated in Orange Mound to Texas. Artists like the duo and others from the south, mainly Texas and Memphis, started to create a new subgenre called
            "crunk" which we can hear the beginnings of here.
