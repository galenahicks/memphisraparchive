    Tennessee rapper GloRilla makes anthems that celebrate female independence with unapologetic intensity. 
    Her 2022 <u class="blueunderline">Hitkidd</u>-produced single "FNF (Let's Go)" was a viral smash, racking up more than eight million plays on 
    streaming services and collecting nearly 25 million views of its accompanying video. GloRilla's overnight success
    quickly led CMG label boss <u class="purpunderline">Yo Gotti</u> to sign her, and she released subsequent singles like "Tomorrow" from the label 
    showcase compilation Gangsta Art. Her debut EP, Anyway, Life's Great..., appeared later in 2022.

    <p>
        GloRilla was born Gloria Hallelujah Woods in the summer of 1999 in Frayser, a neighborhood that leans on I-40 and the 
        Mississippi River on Memphis' north side. She was named after her grandmother. Though she can't remember the origin story 
        of her middle name, she was born into a large and conservative Christian family, the eighth of 10 kids, and acknowledges that
         her religious background may have played a significant role. Growing up, her family didn't practice Christmas traditions like
         gift-giving because they believed they were derived from a Pagan custom. But even with her religious upbringing, music was
          always present. Her parents often played gospel artists like Kirk Franklin and Donnie McClurkin in the house. <br><br>



        Despite her parents' religious beliefs, the hardcore rapper says they have always backed her 
        career choice: “My daddy know I be talking crazy. Him and my mama,” she adds, giggling and shaking her head remembering the time her
         dad called her laughing about the title of her single “Nut Quick.” Normally, though, her parents just follow her moves on the internet.
          “They search me up on YouTube every day and find out everything I done did.” Besides the gospel playing in her background, rap music 
          was also prevalent in her early years: Though GloRilla was an avid 106 & Park viewer like many Y2K kids, it was the street rappers 
          who drew her to the art. “Chief Keef, that's who inspired me to rap,” she says decidedly, reflecting on her early musical taste. 
          “I was a big fan of his.”

   Glorilla talks about <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia's</span></a> and Memphis' influence on her sound
    </p>

 
    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            <br><br>
            “F.N.F.” (an acronym for “Fuck Nigga Free”), the Hitkidd-produced record GloRilla dropped in April, was nothing like the 
            radio-friendly records spinning at the time, especially not from a woman artist. Introducing herself as Big Glo on the track, 
            she raps about breaking free of fuck boys and scrubs over a gritty beat that borrows from Memphis' crunk past. She knew it was a 
            hit, but “I ain't expect it to go crazy like it did,” she says, shaking her head, still in disbelief. When the song took off, she 
            realized she had to shoot an emergency music video to take advantage of its viral popularity and called every single number in 
            her phone to shoot something fast. Her “Glo Gang” of day-one friends dropped everything to come twerk with her under a stoplight 
            and hang out of cars doing donuts in a parking lot. Some of them, like <u class="blueunderline">K Carbon</u>, <u class="blueunderline">Slimeroni</u>,
            <u class="blueunderline">Aleza</u>, and <u class="blueunderline">Gloss Up</u>, who recently 
            signed to Quality Control Music, are talented rappers in their own right.<br><br>

            The track was GloRilla's first Billboard Hot 100 entry, peaking at No. 42, and deemed one of Complex's best songs of 2022. The 
            song gained even more traction after a snippet of the chorus went viral on TikTok, sparking countless #FNFChallenge dance videos,
             and artists like Erica Banks, Kali, and Renni Rucci began dropping freestyles over its instrumental. Glo uploaded the song to 
             streaming platforms on April 29, and by July 5 the emerging rapper confirmed she signed to <u class="purpunderline">Yo Gotti's</u> Collective Music Group imprint. 
             In a video circulating the Internet, Yo Gotti handed GloRilla a $500,000 signing bonus and took her friends to celebrate on a private jet.<br><br>


She shrugs when I ask her why she chose to sign with Gotti, as though the decision was a no-brainer: “You know, it just felt right,” she says. 
Gotti and Glo both hail from Memphis, which she says played a huge factor. It's clear how much she looks up to her label's CEO when she describes
 what he means to her and her city: “Gotti is a hometown hero because he reached back and signed a lot of artists from Memphis”—like her lablelmates 
 <u class="blueunderline">Moneybagg Yo</u>, EST Gee, and 42 Dugg—“myself included.” GloRilla's success already reaches outside of her hometown, but she never neglects to shout
  out her city. “Memphis is top tier when it comes to music. I'm so glad [that] the last couple years we've been getting the notoriety, because 
  Memphis is known for music too,” she says.
