        Young Dolph
    </p>
</div>

<div class="articlebody">
    Born on the South Side of Chicago and raised in notoriously known Castalia Heights neighborhood in South Memphis, Young Dolph emerged 
    in the urban music scene 
    and amassed a large dedicated fan base.
Dolph grew up in a hectic environment, surrounded by drugs and alcohol, but that never completely defined him. He always had a passion for music,
 but it wasn't until his peers recognized his talent and suggested that he take rap seriously. Eventually his hustle mentality and creativity 
 led him to consistently dropping mixtape after mixtape. With authentic punch lines and stern club bangers, he created his own lane of High Class Street Music.

        After releasing his debut mixtape, Paper Route Campaign, in 2008, Young Dolph decided to take his destiny into his own hands.
         Inspired by his fascination with money, Dolph formed Paper Route Empire in 2010. It would become a name that rang bells throughout 
         the music industry. Supported by Dolph mixtapes like Welcome 2 Dolph World, A Time 2 Kill, and the High Class Street Music series, 
         the label quickly rose to prominence.<br><br>
         As a native of Memphis, two of Young Dolph's biggest influences in rap were <a href="8ballMJG.html"><span class="purptext">8Ball & MJG</span></a>, who helped put the city on the map with a string of
          critically-acclaimed album releases throughout the '90s and aughts. A true student of the game, Dolph studied the legendary duo's stylings 
          and recorded at the same Memphis recording studio where 8Ball & MJG worked on music with producer <a href="90sproducers.html"><span class="purptext">DJ Squeeky</span></a> during their heyday. In 2012, 
          Young Dolph had the opportunity to work with the pair on his Blue Magic mixtape track, “While I'm Rollin' Up.” It ended up becoming one of his 
          most successful releases and marked a personal milestone during Dolph's rise to prominence.

        After stamping himself as a mixtape legend, Young Dolph took the next step in his career with the 2016 release of his debut
         studio album, King of Memphis. The album's title ruffled a few feathers and led to his rivalry with... Memphis
         native <u class="purpunderline" id="raiderklanul">Yo Gotti</u> and his CMG collective. But it proved to be another win for the rapper, as the album marked his first appearance 
         on the Billboard 200 as a solo artist. Featuring the hit single, “Get Paid,” which added to his collection of landmark songs King of Memphis
         proved Dolph's ability to compete at the highest level of the industry while betting on himself.<br><br>
         The franchise player of Paper Route Empire, Young Dolph expanded the roster in 2017 with the label's biggest signee to date, Memphis rapper 
         <a href="keyglock.html"><span class="bluetext">Key Glock</span></a> (who also happens to be Dolph's cousin through marriage). After dropping his debut mixtape, Glock Season, later that year, he appeared 
         alongside Dolph on the Gold-certified single, “Major,” in 2018. The following year, they released their collaborative mixtape, Dum and Dummer. 
         Peaking at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, Dum and Dummer spawned a sequel that was released earlier this year featuring the BandPlay-produced 
         standout single, “Aspen.” Having become a budding star in his own right, Key Glock has proved to be a capable protégé to Young Dolph with his
          sophomore album, Yellow Tape 2, recently scoring No. 7 spot on the Billboard 200. Key Glock's latest release confirms Key Glock as next up out of
           Memphis while further strengthening the Paper Route Empire's reputation as one of the strongest independent squads in Hip-Hop.
