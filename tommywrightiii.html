    In his prime, Wright III was one-man gangster rap cottage industry. Between 1992 and 2000, he released five self-produced solo albums, two more with group <u class="purpunderline" id="raiderklanul">Ten Wanted Men</u>
     (which once featured a wanted woman, <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul">La Chat</u>), owned, operated and produced the entirety of Street Smart Records' discography. On the boards, Wright III was a cowbell 
    aficionado and chunky bass savant; on the microphone, he was a murder-mad, speed-rapping goon, his lyrics permanently on the verge of grotesque.

            Still Runnin-N-Gunnin: The Rebirth of Memphis Rap Legend Tommy Wright III [excerpts]</a>

            As the decade turned, the kids who'd done laps on the polished-wood floors of the Crystal Palace roller rink - 
            and who smoked, drank, and brawled in its parking lot - became full-grown clubgoers, musicians and hoodlums. 
            Wright's cohort, raised on gritty, out-of-state rap and widely bootlegged <a href="90sproducers.html"><span class="purptext">Spanish Fly</span></a> cassettes, began 
            synthesizing their influences into music that more accurately reflected their own lives. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            Inspired by the early stirrings of the Memphis rap scene, the young Wright got to work, making music under short-lived aliases MC Robot, MC Electronic and the Independent Rapper. Though 1991's Memphis Massacre is widely believed to be his earliest effort, he'd recorded a tape a year or so earlier. Titled Still Not Quite Human, its cover featured a black-and-white silhouette of Wright being arrested. As for the music, nothing remains to be described here.<br><br>

“It was one or two of the songs from Memphis Massacre and quite a few songs that have gotten away from me, that I don't have access to,” Wright says, his voice heavy with nostalgia and regret. “They're lost in time.”<br>

When Wright decided to record his official debut, he broke the bank. Literally.<br><br>

“I just went ahead and took a piggy bank full of nickels, dimes, quarters and pennies to [local producers] Lyrical Dope and Herbert Young,” he says. “They laughed at me when I cracked it open, but I told them I was serious and I needed to do some songs… I distributed Memphis Massacre by way of taking a backpack to school and selling them [there].”

            Is the cover of 1994's Runnin-N-Gunnin a real mugshot?

    <div class="interviewartist">

            “When I got arrested, it was for, like, a gun,” Wright explains. “I can almost remember that outfit and that shirt. We were caught in a round-up when I had that spray-painted shirt on. I didn't stay in jail long, but the charges definitely started piling up on me from that point on.”<br><br>

            The album's title is appropriate, then. In 1994, Wright was 18 years old, still in high school, a father-to-be and, like a true desperado, walking the streets with a pistol tucked in his waistband.  
        </p>

    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            In spite of his newfound fame, Wright has never pretended that he's the only Memphis rapper worthy of reappraisal. His chestnut brown 
            eyes still light up when asked about artists like <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul2">Gangsta Blac</u>, <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul3">MC Spade</u> and <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul4">Shawty Pimp</u>, who remain overlooked to this day. He's trying
             to show his peers that people care about their music, that they're not failures, and that the lucrative, enthusiastic audiences they once
              craved aren't in South Memphis, but in far-flung corners of the globe, just a couple clicks away.

       Meet Yo Maker by Tommy Wright III is a fast paced, hardcore story that chronicles a hit and run and a Memphis rivalry. Tommy is known for his vivid 
       storytelling, usually delving into dark subject matter and criminal activity, the exact attributes that gave the Memphis underground sound its moniker 
       "horrorcore". On this track we can hear the melody made completely of the famous TR-808 cowbell, which remains prevalent in modern day <a href="phonk.html"><span class="greentext">phonk</span></a>.

            1995 track Still Pimpin'. This shows the timelessness of the Memphis underground sound, and how even the largest artist in the world
            takes inspiration from the sound created in Memphis in the 90s.
