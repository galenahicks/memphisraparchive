            The Okayplayer Interview: SpaceGhostPurrp Reveals The Mysteries of Phonk</a>
    </p>
    </div>

<div class="interview">
    <p>
        In some ways you have a very Miami sound but it also kind of cuts across L.A., New York,
         Memphis and a lot of other places. How does that fit together?


    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        It's just who I am, what I been into all my life, what I know about. If a n*** asks me about 
        underground Memphis rap, I talk to him about it like this [snaps finger]. That's all I know. That's all I would 
        listen to, if I wasn't listening to local Miami rap, I was listening to Memphis rap, or Houston rap or underground 
        New York rap and underground West Coast rap. My whole thing was underground. Cause I felt like people in the underground 
        wasn't getting credit like they should. I just put it all in one and made SpaceGhostPurrp.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interview">
    <p>
        I'm curious about who some of those early influences are because your stuff-it's not necessarily Miami Bass but 
        there's definitely a Bass aesthetic to it. Is it mostly Miami cats or what did you come up on?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        We came up on Trick Daddy. I'm talking about early Trick Daddy. He had the bald head. Thug.com; that type of sh*t. 
        That's Miami, that dark, gloomy-ass, storytelling-ass sh*t. That influenced me growing up, and <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a> and all of 
        them did, too. But my music basically shows how that raw Miami gutter sound really sounds. People will say it sounds like 
        Memphis, it sounds like Houston but at the same time Miami represents that same sound. Our underground has that same type of 
        sound. We will listen to DJ Screw and old underground New Orleans music cause we was on that same sh*t. We all from the south. 
        Me never had the chance to expose that to the industry. We had Uncle Luke with the whole Bass movement but you know, I show people
         what our sound really sounds like - our dark sh*t.

    Purpp speaks on 90s Memphis artists' influence
    </p>

    <div class="interview">
        <p>
            What's the science behind [your clique] Raider Klan? That's something that people might identify with a West Coast-type of 
            vibe, the Raiders hats and all those things. What's the origin of that?
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            The way we come off, it's phonk. We all about that, about that 90s sh*t. We been on that vintage West Coast sh*t hard. 
            In my eyes, West Coast hip-hop back in the days was untouchable. Now it's in another lane. I'm not from the West Coast 
            but I got enough balls to say “You know what? If nobody else don't f*** with that type of sh*t, I'm gonna f*** with it, 
            because I love that rap and I'm gonna bring that sh*t back, I wanna keep it going. I don't have to talk about gangsta sh*t 
            or about killing and selling drugs - it can still be phonk without talking about that. So that's all we're trying to do.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="interview">
        <p>
            A lot of people have described your sound as “trillwave.” Again talking about what goes 
            on in New York and other cities too - do you feel like that's a real movement that you're part of? 
            Or is that just something that people put on it?
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            Yeah, it's like a label. I think they're doing that cause I came to New York and people in New York support my music and I love that. But
             the whole “trill” thing, that's not a movement to me, that's a way of life. Just like Raider Klan is a way of life. It's a lifestyle to 
             be who we are. Being trill in the south, that's everyday. We don't even got to say the word “trill” to be known as that. It's all about
              what you do, less about saying it.

        This video really shows the underground aesthetic that SpaceGhostPurpp was known for,
        that came from a mix of his Miami, Houston and Memphis influences. The south was always
        known for gritty, lofi hip-hop, and SpaceGhostPurpp was one of the first people to 
        help bring that aesthetic to the mainstream influencing and producing for people like A$AP Mob
        and Lil Tracy.
