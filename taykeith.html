    Known for the trunk-rattling bass that he adapted from southern hip-hop royalty like 
    <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a> and  <a href="8ballMJG.html"><span class="purptext">8Ball & MJG</span></a>, Keith emerged in 2018 after tracks he'd made with fellow Memphis native <a href="blocboyjb.html"><span class="bluetext">BlocBoy JB</span></a> caught Drake's attention. 
    From there, the buzz began to spill out of Memphis, putting their local rap sound at the forefront. After starting to make beats at the age of 
    14, Tay Keith had his first hit with Drake and BlocBoy's “Look Alive” by the age of 21. Since then, his hypnotizing bounce has created undeniable
    chemistry with Drake, also heard on tracks like “Nonstop” and “Sicko Mode.”

        Tay Keith Explains How His Memphis Roots Made it on 'Her Loss' [excerpts]</a>

<div class="interview">
    <p>
        Being from Memphis, your sound is often described as that trunk-rattling grit from the south. 
        How would you describe the influence Memphis has on your sound?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        I was born into this shit and raised in this shit. Memphis music is all I listened to and all my family listened to.
         My stepfather who I am still close with really influenced my taste for music. So a lot of the shit he was listening to
          was a lot of Memphis artists. During that time it was like <u class="purpunderline">Playa Fly</u>, <a href="8ballMJG.html"><span class="purptext">8Ball & MJ</span></a>, and you know it's subconsciously stuck 
          with me. The <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6</span></a> and all that shit, like that sound. Most importantly, me being in this Memphis wave and being a big 
          part of Memphis becoming mainstream, I had to do my research on the past artists and the niggas who actually have influenced
           the Memphis sound like <a href="gangstapat.html"><span class="purptext">Gangsta Pat</span></a> and <u class="purpunderline">Gangsta Blac</u> and all that shit. Understanding Memphis history, especially if I'm 
           like the face of it now. I salute them and give them credit, 100 percent.


    </p>
</div>

<div class="interview">
    <p>
        How did “Jimmy Cooks” come together? Knowing that you produced that with Vinylz and CuBeatz, it's three samples on there — 
        “You Were Gone” by Brook Benton, “Just Awaken Shaken” by Playa Fly, and “Blaze Up Anotha One” by Gangsta Blac. How did you all
        blend all of those?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        I mean, not to get too much into that but when it comes to the sample and in general, I felt like Drake wanted to 
        really show people true Memphis culture and the sound within “Jimmy Cooks,” because a lot of people have never heard 
        of Playa Fly. A lot of people have never heard of Gangsta Blac. These are artists that I've known my whole life. 
        I went to school with Playa Fly's daughter, she was a good friend of mine. To actually know, like, damn we were in 
        South Memphis at Lincoln Elementary together and 15, 20 years later I got a Number One song with your daddy. It's a 
        story that can't be made up. Like, this is like a blessing from God. When it came to “Jimmy Cooks,” I did the second 
        part of the beat, so I didn't necessarily do the sample, but just being a part of it shows the true connection that 
        Memphis culture has into the mainstream now.

   Tay Keith talks about influence of Memphis rap on his production

    <div class="interview">
        <p>
            You also have developed chemistry with 21 Savage as well. 
            You worked on “Don't Come Out the House,” which you made with Metro, 
            and he hopped on BlocBoy's “Rover” remix
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            Shout out to 21. He really fuck with Block, because when “Rover” came out, I will never forget the moments, because 
            “Shoot” actually  went viral first. “Shoot” was a big song on Instagram and shit — this was kind of like before the 
            TikTok era. But when I made the “Rover” beat, and I sent it to Block, he automatically knew it was gonna be a hit, bro. 
            So when we dropped it everything just went crazy. Everybody started hitting us up, 21 being one. I fuck with 21 heavy. 
    
        </p>

    <div class="interview">
        <p>
            Can you talk about your creative process for producing tracks on Her Loss?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            I feel like I really had to go back into doing my history on the Memphis artists, because you can only be inspired so long 
            by doing the same shit, you know? I had to go back and look up the Memphis history, get more intrigued by it and listen to all
             of the <u class="purpunderline">Project Pat</u> shit, <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6</span></a>, <u class="purpunderline">Yo Gotti</u> shit, 
             and the older artists like you probably haven't heard of. I was just listening to
              all this shit. And I knew this the type of vibe that I needed to really tap in. So I definitely was in my Memphis bag for the past
               six months. I was going crazy making the majority of my Memphis shit, and also still focusing on different vibes too, sampling and
               shit. Even me going into the studio with 21 a couple months ago and knowing I got the session with him, I'm like, “Man, I know him 
               and Drake got this Memphis chemistry, too.” So I had to tap into it 100 percent.
