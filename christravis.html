        Memphis native Chris Travis makes hazy, narcotic trap inspired by artists like <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a>, <a href="tommywrightiii.html"><span class="purptext">Tommy Wright III</span></a>, 
        and Boosie Badazz. He first gained notice as a member of <a href="spaceghostpurpp.html"><span class="greentext">SpaceGhostPurrp</span></a>'s <u class="greenunderline">Raider Klan</u>, which he joined in 2011 
        after the recommendation of members Amber London and Key Nyata. He left around 2013 to concentrate on his solo work, as well as 
        his Water Boyz label. Mixtapes appeared at a rate of about
         four per year, and Travis' 2013 video "Crunch Time" became a viral hit. In 2014, Travis and fellow ex-Raider Klan members 
         <a href="xavierwulf.html"><span class="greentext">Xavier Wulf</span></a> and Eddy Baker joined up with Michigan-based rapper Bones to form <u class="greenunderline">Seshollowaterboyz</u>.

                I'm from Memphis. I moved everywhere in Memphis: Orange Mound, Bartlett, East Memphis. 
                Fuckin' everywhere. I've been all around, going to different schools. I went to Germantown 
                then Southwind and all them schools in the east.

                What's your writing process like when you're creating your music?

                When I'm on my projects, I write and take my time. But it doesn't take me long to write a song. I'll knock a song out in one
                 day. That's how I make my mixtapes. I'll do a song a day—play it, bump it and see how it sounds. I make plenty music. I make 
                 a lot of music and just put that shit out. I've got so used to doing it, I'll just drop music whenever I want to. I've got plenty of 
                 music on the Internet; that's how my fan base expanded, too.

                I've noticed from looking online as well as listening to your last few projects,
                 you've been talking about the Water Boyz movement. Can you explain that?
            </p>

            <p>
                Aw yeah, Water Boyz. It's my shit I made on some stay pure shit. 
                It's really a positive movement just to get folks to drink water and not sodas. Just being healthy. 
                Actually, what I was doing was trying to get niggas to stop drinking codeine, because after niggas heard Codeine
                 & Pizza they was like, 'aw, I'ma try that. What's codeine?' I was actually trying to get niggas to convert…just to stay pure and drink water.

    <span class="bottomvideotitle">Crunch Time - Chris Travis</span><br>
    Crunch Time is probably Chris' biggest song, and was one of the first songs that took him
    into his own helping him gain fans outside of the RaiderKlan audience. The song uses classic 
    Memphis horrorcore imagery and repetitive synth lines that the genre is known for.

        <span class="bottomvideotitle">Stayin' True - Chris Travis</span><br>
        This is a representation of an earlier, more laid back Chris Travis; he still raps with a Memphis flow, but a much slower
        beat accompanies his relaxed flow, with heavy kicks and the renowned TR-808 cowbell sprinkled throughout the song.
