<div class="articlebody">
    Evolving slowly but steadily over the years, Three 6 Mafia began as an exploitative, horror-themed underground hardcore rap sensation 
    ("666 Mafia," get it?) yet went on to enjoy relatively mainstream success years later, eventually winning an Oscar and scoring some major
    hits. The Memphis, Tennessee group's membership varied from album to album, with the one constant being the duo of Juicy J and DJ Paul, who were
     producers as well as rappers. Other notable Mafia affiliates at one time or another include Crunchy Black, Gangsta Boo, Lord Infamous, 
     Koopsta Knicca, La' Chat, Project Pat, etc.

            <span class="bold">DJ Paul:</span><br><br> We came out the door with an EP—artwork, cover pressed up, shrink wrapped, and everything... That was in 1990.  
            The group was [initially] called the Serial Killaz, and the name of the tape was Portrait of a Serial Killa. After that,
             I went to the regular mixtapes on TDK tapes. [Note: A collection of Paul's mixtape-era tracks can be found on 
             Underground Vol. 1: (1991-1994).]

            My daddy always used to tell me that I was going to be the next Michael Jackson. And I was like, “Dad, 
            I don't think that's going to happen.” But I would try. He would put me in organ lessons, and he bought me an 
            organ that I still have—a $5,000 organ he bought for me back in 1985 when I was a kid. Between me being in love with
             horror movies and having an organ, which is a creepy instrument anyway, that all just went hand-in-hand and made it happen.

                There have been a whole bunch of recent hits that have been based on Three 6-related songs. Why do you think that's happening now?

                To be honest with you, I feel that people got tired of the sound that was going on because there was a lot of crappy rappers the last few years. People are back ready to have fun in the clubs. People are ready to get back crunk. They ready to get back to having fun and dancing in the club and tearing clubs up, and I think that's why they started to discover where they came from.<br><br>

Shout out to the ASAP crew. They were always big fans of ours and they always kept some Three 6 samples going on. “Plain Jane” is huge, and that's a Three 6 Mafia sample. So they influence a lot of the young guys to want to sample it, as well. G-Eazy's “No Limit” is huge, so people are like, “Damn, everybody who sample Three 6 Mafia are making hit songs around this motherfucker.” I just cleared a couple more samples for ASAP Ferg that's finna come out. I've been clearing three samples a week: movies, TV shows. I just cleared one for a Jim Carrey movie.

                The craziest thing is that right now is your second career revival after your historic Oscar win in 2006 for "It's Hard Out Here For a Pimp". You're on life number three at this point. Can we expect another revival in 2030?

                [Laughs] I think so, man. Because it's good music. Think about this, too: maybe 10-15 years from now, they will be sampling those guys who sampled us, and I will get paid from that, as well. So I will be long gone out the music world probably 20 years from now, and guys like ASAP Ferg will be the old-school cats that the new guys will be sampling. They will sample songs which will bring me right back into the picture. Not directly—they won't know. But my name will be in the print. I'll be a part of that check.

            This song by A$AP Ferg is a prime example of how Three 6's music continues to influence modern hip-hop. Plain Jane interpolates
            Slob on My Knob by Tear Da Club up Thugs (aka Three 6 Mafia), with part of the chorus taking exact lyrics from the song and the rest being a 
            rewrite of the original.
