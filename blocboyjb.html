    BlocBoy may be 21, but he's well in tune with the legendary rappers of the early millennium. In an interview with XXL, 
    BlocBoy spoke about some of his major influences. “<a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a>, Eminem, Jay-Z, Nelly,” explains BlocBoy.
Memphis rapper BlocBoy JB scores platinum hits with his combination of speedy rhymes and big bass instrumentals from longtime 
producer <a href="taykeith.html"><span class="bluetext">Tay Keith</span></a>. After releasing a series of well-received mixtapes, he caught the attention of Canadian rapper Drake, who 
collaborated with him on the viral single "Look Alive." The track reached the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100, and along with a 
viral dance craze, it helped solidify JB's commercial success.

        Produced By BlocBoy: Rapper/Producer BlocBoy JB Is Taking His Memphis Twang and a Signature Dance Worldwide [excerpts]</a>
</p>
</div>



<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        When BlocBoy arrived, I could tell he had been shuffling around from city to city, making the rounds required of a newly-minted rap star.
         It's been a few months since “Look Alive,” the Drake collaboration that took his already bubbling career into hyperdrive, and he's striking
          while the iron is hot. A remix with 21 Savage, a feature for A$AP Rocky—even his ad-libs were interpolated in Childish Gambino's #1 single 
          “This Is America.” Meanwhile, his “Shoot” dance has everyone from Lil Uzi Vert to Fortnite avatars in step. And without missing a beat himself,
           BlocBoy just released Simi, his first mixtape since becoming a viral phenomenon. He has flooded the mainstream with his instantly recognizable
            Memphis twang.<br><br>
            When I ask if he's tired, though, he denies it with authority. And with his blunt and an apple juice in hand, he starts to lighten up a bit.
             “That skinny ass dog, man,” he observes, having noticed a frail Italian Greyhound struggling on its leash. Cracking himself up for a second,
              smiling with his gold teeth, he returns to our conversation. We've been talking about 8 Mile, one of his favorite movies.<br><br>
              “He was a hood nigga,” explains BlocBoy, explaining how he relates to Eminem's character in the film. “Basically, if you color blind, you
               ain't gotta see it like, 'Ah, he white.' Nah, he just another nigga in the hood, really, rapping. Like me, basically.”

   BlocBoy and <a href="taykeith.html"><span class="bluetext">Tay Keith</span></a> talk about how they first started working together
    </p>

    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            His training ground was the collected desk surfaces of the Memphis school system. “We used to beat on tables in the classroom and check people.
             That's how it started, the classroom. When the teachers left, we'd just beat on tables, and everybody would get to rapping. Making fun of folks. 
             Shit, they'd check me, then I'd have to come back. And I been rapping ever since then.” BlocBoy starts beating on the side of the SUV to 
             illustrate all it would take to get kids to battle back in his school days. That universal rhythm of the clenched-fist-meets-desk kick drum
              served as the canvas for countless outfit-based humiliations across the globe.<br><br>

            At the time of our conversation, BlocBoy's most recent hit is one he produced himself, a fact made unmistakable by its title: “Prod By Bloc.”
             We start talking about the song because the beat itself is reminiscent of that same makeshift classroom percussion. No instrumentation, no melody, 
             just simple drums. In its accompanying music video, BlocBoy and his friends use kitchen utensils to beat against pots and pans in sync with the
              rhythm of the actual track.

    <span class="bottomvideotitle">Shoot - BlocBoy JB</span><br>
    This song by BlocBoy JB represents the largest part of BlocBoy's legacy, as the dance that he does in this music video, the "shoot", was
    one of the biggest dance crazes of the past 10 years blowing up on social media outlets like TikTok and even being implemented in Fortnite.
