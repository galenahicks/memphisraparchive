    After several stints behind bars for marijuana possession, 
    Wulf declared to change his life. "Look bro. This is bullshit. 
    I changed my name to Ethelwulf and I started turning up on some Memphis shit.” 
    He recorded under the moniker (which translates to "Noble wolf") in 2012, releasing his debut 
    “1st Chapta of Tha Phonk." He soon linked with <a href="spaceghostpurpp.html"><span class="greentext">SpaceGhostPurrp</span></a> and the <u class="greenunderline" id="raiderklanul">Raider Klan</u>. Before long, 
    he amassed substantial plays on SoundCloud for tracks like 2013's "Black Mist" (with <a href="christravis.html"><span class="greentext">Chris Travis</span></a>) and
     "Trillnation" with Amber London and 2014's "Tapes."

    <p>
        You were one of the first rappers to build a big<br>following on SoundCloud...
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        I remember the day I found SoundCloud. I had no idea it would be what it is today. I ain't gonna lie—back in my day, 
        shit was a little different. The underground shit, it started out a certain way. Like, real niggas only, just killing 
        shit underground. But now some fuck shit slid through and popped off. There are some dudes that got by off of the formula 
        that me and a few of my peers laid down. They connected that formula and it's not real a lot of times.<br><br>


The term "SoundCloud rapper," I hate that shit so much. Shit make me wanna not even use SoundCloud anymore. But the fact that I'm an OG, 
I'm one of the first niggas who was on that shit—that's why it don't bother me. A lot of these niggas have no idea what SoundCloud was back in my 
day. And when I say “my day,” that was only like five years ago. But SoundCloud wasn't like that.<br><br>


I remember <a href="christravis.html"><span class="greentext">Chris Travis</span></a> didn't even have a SoundCloud, but I told him, "This is a good site right here. Look how it displays 
the song and shit in the little bubble. It's cool and it's easy. You can get the link on Twitter and all that.” Fast forward like a 
year and half, when we got to Cali, Bones didn't have a SoundCloud either. So we made him make one. It was just the easiest way to share
 music and get the music out there. Shouts out to SoundCloud.

        What kind of music were you listening to<br>growing up?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        “I grew up in the late '90s, so I caught that tail end of all the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,
         <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a>, <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul">Project Pat, DJ Paul, 
         Juicy J</u>, <a href="gangstaboo.html"><span class="purptext">Gangsta Boo</span></a>, <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul2">Koopsta</u>, and 
         <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul3" >Scarecrow</u>. 
         When I grew up as a kid I never planned on being a rapper. But as a kid, when a song came on
          in the car that was too slow or R&B, I didn't like it. I liked the rap stuff. The hard stuff. 
          I've learned to appreciate all kinds of music now, but when I was young, I used to hate anything but hard rap.”<br><br>


“Also, for all the rappers that want to do Memphis type music or try to, that shit corny. You can't do
 Memphis music unless you a Memphis dude. You've gotta be born and raised in Memphis in order to qualify.
 Straight up. So I have an advantage. Can't nobody make music like Memphis niggas. The attitude and shit, it's 
 just genuinely authentic. I make the type of music I make and it's not really hard. I just do me. I do Memphis.”

    This song showcases Xavier's early music,

    samples “No Matter Whatever” by <u class="purpunderline" id="juicyjul4">Graveyard Productions AKA Children

        This shows Xavier's later style, still using those classic Memphis triplet flows,
         dark subject matter, and heavy Memphis drums, but with a more modern, clean production.
