<div class="articlebody">
    One of the first Memphis rappers to make the major-label jump, Gangsta Pat never attained the acclaim or success of fellow Memphis pioneers 
    <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a> and  <a href="8ballMJG.html"><span class="purptext">Eightball & MJG</span></a>, yet he still remains noteworthy for his trailblazing. Pat's career began promisingly when Atlantic signed
     him at the dawn of the gangsta rap era...
    Pat sped up his flow à la Bone and darkened his themes à la Three 6 Mafia. Regardless, despite the cult following he began to garner with 
    these two highly regarded albums, he couldn't translate the support into national sales, and he moved on to yet another label, Red Rum. He 
    remained there for quite a while, releasing a string of albums... that tended to emulate the trends of 
    their respective eras. Pat targeted Three 6 Mafia on his 1999 album, Tear Yo Club Down, with a pointed dis track.

            Memphis rap is inextricable from the city's greater, ever-vibrant musical continuum. The genre's origins lay as much in sweaty
             Beale Street juke joints and smoke-filled sessions at Stax as they do in <a href="90sproducers.html"><span class="purptext">Spanish Fly's</span></a> bedroom tapes, and Gangsta Pat is partially
              indebted to the former. His father, the drummer Willie “Too Big” Hall, was a Stax house musician who played with the Bar-Kays, 
              Isaac Hayes' band The Movement and Booker T. & the MG's. Pat inherited his father's musicianship and, eventually, the internal 
              strife of his family's financial and emotional fluctuations. According to Pat's self-produced autobiographical documentary, 
              Gangsta Pat: Biography of a Gangster Rapper, after a period of emotional and physical abuse his parents divorced, leaving he 
              and his mother bereft.<br><br>

            After spending much of his adolescence running afoul of the law, Pat's rap career began in earnest when Miami-based On Top Records began distributing his 1990 debut, “I'm Tha Gangsta / Shootin' On Narcs.” (If either song sounds specifically Memphian, it's the latter with its chunky bass. “I'm Tha Gangsta” could otherwise be a D.O.C. outtake.) Later in the year, On Top released his album, #1 Suspect, whose regional popularity earned Pat the attention of Atlantic Records.

In 1991, Atlantic re-released #1 Suspect. It was both the first Memphis rap record issued by a major label and the last record Gangsta Pat would release on 
Atlantic - he was dropped shortly thereafter. If Pat was bowed by his failure, it didn't last. Between 1992 and 2001 he recorded nine albums, 
cementing him as a bona fide regional star. When asked by Nah Right about Pat, rapper and one-time record store owner <u class="purpunderline" id="raiderklanul">Kingpin Skinny Pimp</u> responded:
 “Gangsta Pat… had [his] own little style and it was so valuable, but nobody really knew its worth, or if they did it wasn't out there for everyone to
  really hear it... You could sell a Gangsta Pat tape in Mississippi or in Arkansas for $25 or $30. People wanted it so bad...They just wanted it because 
  the style was so unique. All his shit was hard as fuck. It was real gangsta-ass music.”

       This song by Gangsta Pat shows his earlier West Coast influenced style. It incorporates much more of the Cali sound that was really popular at the time,
       and doesn't have that classic Memphis feel; however this is how he started out when he was signed by Atlantic.

            I Wanna Smoke shows how Gangsta Pat came back to his Memphis origins. His faster flow resembled more of the local rappers in his class while the beats still
            contained some of that West Coast feeling that he was inspired by during the gansta rap era.
