<div class="articlebody">
    In the blink of an eye, NLE Choppa went from a Memphis high school student to a viral sensation.
    The rapper was born as Bryson Potts on November 1, 2002, in Memphis, Tennessee. As a teen at Cordova High School, 
    he began freestyling and rapping with friends for fun when he was 14, and officially launched his rap career at the age of 15 in 2018.
    Thanks to singles like “Camelot” and his first major hit, “Shotta Flow,” NLE Choppa has become one of the biggest breakout rappers of 2019.
    His music videos are racking up hundreds of millions of views on YouTube alone, and he's just getting started.

        What was it like growing up in East Memphis?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        It was a bit of a struggle because Memphis is not the most beautiful place with people's behaviour and the way that people act.
         It was tough but it made me who I was and I'm forever grateful for that.


    </p>
</div>

<div class="interview">
    <p>
        Do you think that growing up in Memphis shaped you and prepared you for life in a way that not many places can?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewartist">
    <p>
        Yeah man, for sure! It built a part of me on the inside. I was able to build a type of strength and to be able to overcome
         whatever God puts in front of me as a test. It made me a survivor because I feel that Memphis is one of those places where
          people are trying to live, but also trying to survive!

   NLE Choppa talks about what he wants his music to inspire
    </p>

    <div class="interview">
        <p>
            Is it hard to stay humble and grounded when you've achieved so much fame and success at such a young age?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            Not really because I feel like as I have grown into who I am becoming I have learnt certain practices that keep me grounded.
             This includes simple prayer- making sure I say a prayer every day, meditation, to take in gratefulness- be grateful for everything
              that has happened to me because I remember times when things weren't moving for me. These are just certain practices I've been 
              learning as I've been maturing and growing as a man and it's been working for me. 
    
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="interview">
        <p>
            When making an album do you feel pressure to live up to expectations and your high standards? Or as you're still so young 
            does that relieve some pressure?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="interviewartist">
        <p>
            Musically I feel I always step up to the plate. But it's more so about the pressure of hoping everyone else likes the music. 
            But y'know, musically I can always make the best music - the music is the easy part… It's just about getting it to the world.
