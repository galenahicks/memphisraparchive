    The first track he recorded himself was a freestyle of Future's “Ain't No Way Around It” in 2011, when he was 12 years old. He was big on 
    Three 6 Mafia and describes Southern rap legend <u class="purpunderline" id="raiderklanul">Project Pat</u> as “the Drake of Memphis.” Specifically, he says Pat's “If You Ain't From My Hood”
     and “Gorilla Pimp” changed his life. The latter's chorus — “I hustle on the low, dig dat / I ain't tryin' to go for broke, dig dat” — inspired 
     one of Glock's breakout singles, “Dig That.”
When Paper Route Empire's Daddy O and <a href="youngdolph.html"><span class="bluetext">Dolph</span></a> eventually signed Glock in 2017, they made sure not to coddle their protégé.

        “At home I always gotta look over my back,” he says of Memphis, between pulls from the Russian Cream-flavored cigar. 
        “You gotta look over your back everywhere you go, but it's a thin line at home. I just gotta play my cards right, and be smart.”.<br><br>
        With his raw reality raps and signature “The Fuck?!” ad lib, Glock's got the hot hand right now. Currently signed to his cousin-through-marriage 
        <a href="youngdolph.html"><span class="bluetext">Young Dolph's</span></a> Paper Route Empire imprint, the 20-year-old turned heads with his debut 2017 mixtape, Glock Season. Arguably one of the best 
        lyricists to emerge from the rough and tumble “Memphis Ten” since <a href="8ballMJG.html"><span class="purptext">8Ball and MJG</span></a>, the buzz around Glock intensified with the early-2018 release 
        of his exceptional Glock Bond, which features his biggest hit to date, “Russian Cream.” What might easily be dismissed as a weed anthem is 
        actually a full-on display of Glock's underrated lyrical prowess: “Feel like Tarzan, all these trees / I get so high I can't breathe / 
        Like LeBron, bitch I'm a king / But I never leave my heat.”

    Glock talks about growing up in Memphis

            Key Glock was born Markeyvius Cathey in south Memphis. When he was 18 months old, his mother was sent to prison, 
            where she'd be over the course of the next 16 years, in both state and federal facilities. Glock's father was in and out 
            of his life, so his grandmother stepped in to raise him, making sure that young Markeyvious stayed in contact with his mother. 
            “I was 5, 6, 7 years old, [and] I was going to Minnesota, West Virginia, federal and state facilities — just to visit my mother,” he remembers.<br><br>
    
            Without the quintessential nuclear family, Glock's interest in street life grew. Coming of age in south Memphis was a matter of
             natural selection, he says, emphasizing that survival was a daily struggle. “It's like the jungle, except it's concrete,” he 
             says blankly. “Still got the prey and the predators. Eat or be eaten — that's what it is out there.” Glock jokes that like Tupac 
             and Afeni Shakur, he and his mother sometimes traded stints behind bars. “Me and my momma a whole different breed,” says Glock, 
             who was hit with aggravated assault charges when he was 18. “It has been times where she in jail and I'm not, I'm in jail and she not.”
