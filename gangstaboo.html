    Known within the <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a> southern rap outfit as Miss Lady, Gangsta Boo began her solo career -- jump-started by fellow Mafia members' Juicy J and DJ Paul's Hypnotize Minds Production Co. -- with 1998's Enquiring Minds.
Gangsta Boo is a Memphis native, who at the age of 15, earned a position in the Three 6 Mafia and appeared on some of the posse's first underground recordings.
Since her career began, Boo has emerged as one of rap's leading ladies, proving that females have what it takes to rise above what was until recently, a male-dominated scene.

            Gangsta Boo: "I Hear My Cadence in a Lot of Rappers" [excerpts]</a>

            <span class="bold">Gangsta Boo:</span><br><br> "I would honestly say that I have to admit, respectfully and humbly, that I am the blueprint," Boo, who got her start alongside Three Six Mafia in the early 90s, said. "I hear my cadence in a lot of men and female rappers. It's hard to f- lie to myself and says, “Oh wow, she's from New York but she raps like she's from Memphis. Oh wow, this person is from f- wherever, but they rap like they are from Memphis.” Because I'm not talking about anybody in particular, but my sound is a Memphis sound. It's a Gangsta Boo sound, it's a Three 6 Mafia sound." <br><br>

            She went on to explain how in many ways, she's the blueprint for a lot of southern rap. "I am the blueprint and I wear that badge proudly as f-," she said. "I used to run away from it. I used to didn't want to even give myself flowers because I've been so low-key and humble, but I'm on some f- that s—. It's time to claim what's mine. I'm one of the main b-. And it feels fun to still be able to look good and be relevant in a place where I don't have this million-dollar machine behind me and I have all my natural body parts, no shade to the ones that don't. But it just feels great to stand in yourself and look in the mirror and be like, “Wow, you did that.” And not sell your soul and go to bed at night with a smile on your face. Because I don't have any pressure."

            The Memphis vet also talked about her city's influence on southern rap and Hip-Hop in general,
             pointing out that they created crunk music. Indeed, Memphis' influence is well-documented in the early 
             music of Memphis legends like <a href="90sproducers.html"><span class="purptext">DJ Squeeky</span></a>, <u class="purpunderline">Kingpin Skinny Pimp</u>, <a href="tommywrightiii.html"><span class="purptext">Tommy Wright III</span></a>, 
             <u class="purpunderline">Playa Fly</u>, and of course <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three Six</span></a> and <a href="8ballMJG.html"><span class="purptext">Eightball & MJG</span></a>. <br><br>
             <span class="bold">Gangsta Boo:</span><br><br>
"Memphis is the originator of crunk," she said. "That's obvious. Shout out to my boy Lil Jon, that's my brother. But he knows 
that as well. Memphis is the originator of crunk. So, Memphis sound is crunk, get buck. The Memphis sound is <a href="8ballMJG.html"><span class="purptext">8 Ball & MJG</span></a>. The 
Memphis sound is <a href="youngdolph.html"><span class="bluetext">Young Dolph</span></a>. Memphis sound is <a href="threesixmafia.html"><span class="purptext">Three 6 Mafia</span></a>. It's laid back, it's player, it's rowdy, it's pimpish, it's smooth, 
it's jazz, it's rhythm, it's blues. Memphis is the home of the blues. And it comes across in our music too with the dark baseline, 
with the heavy baselines, the high hats. Keeping this s— Memphis."

       This song by Gangsta Boo displays her uniquely Memphis flow; you can hear the similarities in flow that she has to her other Three 6 companions, but you 
       can also hear her unique layered vocals and energy that made her stand out as one of the group's most popular members, allowing her to expand past Three 6 Mafia 
       into a solo career of her own.

            This song by Gangsta Boo is another showcase of Memphis excellence. This song samples Love Don't Live Here Anymore by Rose Royce but maintains
            that Memphis bounce with the booming kick, syncopated hi-hats and loud snare that we're used to.
